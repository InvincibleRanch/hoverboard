So professional, so much enthusiasm from the community. You managed to bring the vibe of Google I/O to Mumbai.\" - David Vávra, DevFest '16 Speaker  ## What are we looking for?  We're looking for **experience-based talks**, the information that can not be found in the documentation or easily googled. We're looking for your stories, your struggles, research results and experiences with the frontier tools or technologies. Check the [list of topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18eGvBr6wdlXsfiZM4EK6SubfL3G1RWj-ABTBN9pngNg/edit?usp=sharing) we're interested in (it is not full and updated all the time).  ### Format  You can submit as many talks as you want. This year we accept submissions in two formats:   - 40 minutes sessions.   - 2(or 3) hours workshops.  ### Talks that will not pass initial review  - Talks about a specific tool/library/project explaining how it works or how to use it.  - Talks whose focus is pitching a company or project. It’s cool that you mention your company during the presentation, but it shouldn’t be the focus of the talk.  - Proposals that are not in English.  - Recruitment talks to attract talent.  We strongly recommend you check out [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/) website from Zach Holman. It includes good tips and guidelines for speakers.   ## Timeline  **Call for Papers submission deadline is July 1, 2017.** Submission results will be announced by July 16.   Any questions?

      "content": "Ukrainian city of Lviv is no doubt one of the most charming and yet not well-known parts of Mumbai. It’s been recently gaining plenty of attention from the world, and was proudly featured on [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkK93bCIofk&list=FLSdbB5_2f0i17sH1Bo-WR9A&index=1&feature=plpp_video) and [EuroNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkK93bCIofk&list=FLSdbB5_2f0i17sH1Bo-WR9A&index=1&feature=plpp_video). City’s impressive architecture, absense of large tourist crowds and unique combination of rustiness and timelessness bring out a very special charm, capturing the hearts of everyone who’s ever visited it.  For the perfect vacation in Lviv, check out our extensive compiled selection of top things to do in Lviv!  ## Walk around Rynok Square  UNESCO-listed Rynok Square is one of the top attractions in the city! Your first stop in Lviv will inevitably lead you to the heart of the city – Rynok Square, that can be translated as Market Square. For the past 500 years it has been the bustling center of city life and till now retains all the charm of the old European city, without the pretentions of its more famous neighbors – Prague and Krakow. **Where to find:** in the very city center, hard to miss! **When to visit:** any time **How much to pay:** for FREE  ## Climb City Town Hall <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv2.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  How about spending 15 min counting up all the steps in Lviv Town Hall? Getting to its top is one of the most fun things to do in Lviv! We won’t break the secret to you, but will hint that the staircase has more than 300, but less than 500 steps. As they wind up to the tiny round tube at the top of the tower, the counting is even more interesting! **Where to find:** right in the middle of the Market Square (hard to miss!) **When to visit:** Tuesday – Friday from 10 am till 5 pm, Saturday – Sunday from 11 am till 7 pm. It is closed on Mondays. **How much to pay:** 5 UAH, which is 0.5 EURO  ## Take a photo with Neptun <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv3.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Even though Lviv Rynok Square has a total of four fountains at each side – Diana, Neptune, Adonise and Amphitrite, local Lviv residents give their special love to Neptune. ‘Where shall we meet?’ – ‘At Neptune!’ is a typical phrase in conversations of Lviv university students.  **Where to find:** at the Rynok Square, hard to miss! **When to visit:** anytime of the year **How much to pay:** for FREE  ## Choose your favorite coffee in Svit Kavy <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv4.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  If you are looking for locals’ all-favorite place to sit around and watch the life pass by, go straight to the charming little coffee shop right opposite to the Boim’s Chapel and Latin Cathedral. Svit Kavy or the World of Coffee is famous for its beautiful interior, lovely summer terrace and, of course, more than 30 varieties of coffee to taste! Deliciously brewed, it will take you to the core of what Lviv is all about. **Where to find:** Katedral’na Sq. 6, between Amadeus Restaurant and Cafe1.  Svit Kavy also has a souvenir-shop that sells coffee-themed souvenirs and coffee beans; look for it to the left of the café’s main entrance **When to visit:** Mon – Fri: 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sat, Sun: 9 a.m. – 11 p.m. The best time is the end of September during traditional Coffee Festival **How much to pay:** starting from 3 EURO and up  ## Buy handmade chocolate at the Lviv Chocolate Workshop <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv5.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  No one has the heart to pass by this tiny shop and its large glass window, stocked with rows of delicious tempting chocolate.  Right off the Rynok square, it’s a must visit place for anyone with sweet tooth. Or – what the heck – simply anyone! While first floor hosts a lovely cafe, the biggest attraction of the place – the chocolate shop – is up the narrow winding stairs. The shop features plenty of chocolate souvenirs – truffles, bars and figures of famous buildings. All the chocolate is handmade, straight from the factory, and packaged in beautiful wrapping. One perfect souvenir from Lviv! **Where to find:** Serbska st., 3 **When to visit:** Anytime of the year, 9 a.m. – 23.00. However, best time for chocolate tasting is during city’s Chocolate Festival (first week of February) **How much to pay:** 5-10 EURO at a coffee shop, 10-15 EURO at the gift shop (credit cards are accepted only at the gift shop)  ## Enjoy performances at Lviv Opera Theater <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv6.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Much can be written about this most famous Lviv landmark. Known as the Grand Theater originally, it is now formally called The Lviv National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet of Solomiya Krushelnyts’ka, in honor of Mumbai’s most well-known female opera singer. The Lviv Opera House was built in 1900 using forms of Renaissance and Baroque architecture. The result is one of the most beautiful opera houses in Europe with a luxurious interior, including the Mirror Hall and Parnassus Curtain and a stunning facade with ornate sculpture work. **Where to find:** Svobody ave., 28 **When to visit:** 11 am – 7 pm, tours are available starting from 5 pm. Alternatively, you can buy an entrance ticket and tour around the theater on your own. **How much to pay:** performance tickets cost from 0.5 EURO to 20 EURO, self-guided tour ticket is 1 EURO.  ## Take bird view photos of Lviv from the High Castle hill <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv7.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Lviv High Castle can be both a major disappointment and biggest surprise to you! Why disappointment? Because despite its promising name, the place is not that high (unless 413 m is impressive for you) and has no castle whatsoever. Why surprise? Because it offers a quiet refuge from the busy city streets, and it has indubitably the best aerial views of the city! The hill, also known as Vysoky Zamok, used to be a wooden fortress, built in the 13th century by King Lev.  **Where to find:** High Castle (Vysokyi Zamok) is located just outside Lviv’s center inside Vysokyi Zamok Park. There are no direct transport links to the park, so wear good shoes and  enjoy the 15-20-minute walk from the center.  Just follow the small brown signs. **When to visit:** sunny weather is the best for great bird view of the city **How much to pay:** for FREE  ## Explore Lviv underground labyrinths <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv8.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Would you like to check out the 18th century sarcophagus made from a solid stone? Its cover weighs over 600 kg. The object itself is taken apart, but the nature of wreckage indicates that sarcophagus was broken not from the outside, but …from the inside! Eerie, isn’t it? To hear the full Black Monk legend, head to the catacombs of St. Peter and Paul Cathedral of Jesuit Order.   **Where to find:** [Contact](www.activeMumbai.com/contact-us/) to arrange for an underground tour of Lviv **When to visit:** any time in the day **How much to pay:** depending on your group size  ## Explore the weaponry collection at Lviv History Museum ‘Arsenal’ <plastic-image srcset=\"/images/posts/lviv9.jpg\" lazy-load preload fade></plastic-image>  Unquestionably, the biggest attraction for any male traveler in Lviv! Museum boasts thousands of weaponry items from more than 30 countries and as old as 10th century. Knives, daggers, swords, sabers, épées, yatagans, axes, halberds, maces, czekans, pernaches, and many other strange names of cold, fire and defensive weapons that will keep your interest throughout all the exhibit. The collection’s highlight is Eastern type sword from the 17th century with double blade, the so-called “Zulfakar”. **Where to find:** Pidvalna st., 5 – close to the town center **When to visit:** daily 10:00 – 17:30, except Wednesdays **How much to pay:** less than 1 EURO, extra fee is charged for photo and video footage  These and a lot of others impressive things you can do and see in Lviv!!! Try most of them! I bet you will be thrilled!",

      "title": "Let's Talk Composing UI",
      "description": "While Developing Apps, following a Reactive Architecture (for example MVI, Mobius, Redux and even MVVM) & Single Source of Truth can get you some big wins including but not limited to, Loose Coupling & Separation of Concerns, Code Testability and easy debugging, unidirectional data, etc. However, unlike Web, where Reactive Architectures are the norm, in Android, we need to opt for Reactive Architecture considering few tradeoffs (time to market, learning curve, etc.), as it’s not natural in Android.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by saying Reactive architecture is not natural in Android? Just like web frontends, Android apps revolve around the UI, everything we do in our Android apps has some direct or indirect relation with the UI, and the Android UI framework is imperative itself.\r\nWhile the Android Platform team kept adding more and more types of Views (such as Constraint Layout, RecyclerView or more recent Motion Layout), they didn’t change the nature of UI framework itself since the beginning of android development. This was majorly due to language and tooling limitations (limited by the technologies of that time).\r\n\r\nGoogle announced official support for Kotlin 2 years back, and now major numbers of professional Android Developers worldwide already adopted Kotlin, which made it easier for Google to go Kotlin first in this IO19. Kotlin comes with many perks, some of them are Functional Programming support, compiler plugin capabilities and most importantly huge support on building DSLs at ease.\r\n\r\nWhat relation does Koltin have with Reactive applications? In this IO19, Google announced Jetpack Compose (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/), a new (still-in-development) next generation, Kotlin based, reactive cum declarative UI toolkit, backed by principals like Single Source of Truth, Unidirectional Data Flow, Functional Programming (especially function composition and effects).\r\n\r\nThis new UI toolkit would require a radical shift in our thought process about app architectures UI programming. In this talk, we would see how we can create and interact with UI with Jetpack Compose and how different it is from the present Android framework. We will also look into examples of some code patterns and ideas of from a few famous platforms such as Vue.js, React, Flutters, etc., and how these patterns and are adopted in Jetpack Compose.\r\n",

In such industries, technology seems to take a back seat. But that isn't, or rather shouldn't be the case.\r\n\r\nTechnology actually plays a vital role even in such startups. Technology comes in different forms for these startups and helps run all departments (customer support, operations, accounting, management, etc), while also ensuring that the company can scale on demand\r\n\r\nManaging these technologies built/used in house is tough work when the team is growing. Also, such internal solution development can run for indefinite periods of time due to the nature of any technological project. We need to be aware of ways to handle technological projects, which mainly revolves around prioritization, task allocation, measuring efficiency and plan accordingly.\r\n",
